# SI101-Coding1-Working-with-Nested-Data

Welcome to the first coding homework in SI101.  This code should be opened using the "Open in Codespaces" option in the Google Classroom invite. If you opened it by clicking on the link, close this and try again.

It may take a few minutes to load, but once complete you will everything you need to get started.

1. Close any Codespace panels you don't need.

2. When you are ready to begin, to the left you should see Student_Copy_of_Homework_One_Coding_Component.  Click in and the file  should open in a Jupyter notebook.

3. Find the first cell under Getting Starter -- the code cell should start with
      ## Starter data

4. Run this cell. Python should already by installed for you, but if you are prompted select the lowest number offered.

This coding component is only part of your first homework - there is also a quiz you need to complete when you are done to test your understanding.
