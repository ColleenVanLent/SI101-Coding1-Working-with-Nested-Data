        "Instead of focusing on *how* the data is collected, this notebook emphasizes **understanding, accessing, and updating nested data structures** in Python.\n",

        "- Using **indexes** to connect related pieces of data\n",
        "- Accessing and updating **nested dictionary values**\n",
        "- Applying **string methods** to clean and format user input\n",
        "- Performing basic calculations using values stored in dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point in the course, you have **not** learned loops or conditionals yet. For that reason, all tasks in this notebook are designed to be completed **without writing loops or `if` statements**.\n",
        "\n",
